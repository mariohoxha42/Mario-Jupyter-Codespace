# Welcome to my NBA Analytics Repo!

Here I am extracting NBA data from past and the previous NBA seasons to consolidate player performance. 

My next step is to build a model where I can attempt to predict future player performance based on past performance, age, and time spent in the league.

Please run the 1-orchestration-engine.ipynb file before running the visuals for the most up-to-date data. 

Visuals can display data in yearly totals, per-36, and per-game basis.
